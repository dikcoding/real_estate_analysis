# 🏡 Real Estate Analysis

## 📌 About the Project

Real estate market analysis provides valuable insights into property trends, pricing, and key influencing factors. This project leverages NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to process and analyze property data, enabling users to explore pricing trends based on land area, number of rooms, and location.

The goal of this project is to clean, analyze, and visualize real estate data to identify key market patterns and trends.

## 🔍 Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning** (`data_loader.py`)

   - Reads property data from CSV format.
   - Cleans missing or inconsistent values.
   - Converts data into structured formats for analysis.

2. **Data Analysis** (`analysis.py`)

   - Performs statistical analysis on property pricing.
   - Identifies key trends and correlations between features.

3. **Data Visualization** (`visualization.py`)

   - Generates graphs to visualize property price trends.
   - Uses Matplotlib for trend analysis and insights.

4. **Main Execution** (`main.py`)
   - Orchestrates the entire process, integrating data loading, analysis, and visualization.

## 🛠 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (optional, for data visualization)

## How to Use

1. Load and Clean Data:

   ```bash
   python app/data_loader.py
   ```

2. Analyze Property Trends:

   ```bash
   python app/analysis.py
   ```

3. Generate Visualizations:

   ```bash
